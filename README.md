# XRPTipBot-Skill Overview
The XRPTipBot-Skill lets you check your XRP TipBot-Balance and you are also able to send tips to your contacts within a few seconds. All you need is your voice!

# XRPTipBot-Skill Details

## Checking your balance
To check your balance, use one of the following commands:
- "Alexa, ask Tip Bot for my balance."
- "How many XRP do I have?"
- "What is my balance?"

## Sending tips to your contacts
To send a tip to one of your contacts, just say:
- "Alexa, tell Tip Bot to send 0.01 XRP"
- "send XRP"
- "send XRP to {user_name}"
- "send 0.01 XRP"

Alexa will then guide you through the dialog for sending a tip to one of your contacts.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Due to some limitations of the Alexa voice service, you are only able to give one piece of information at a time:
Whether the amount OR the Username.
When providing both, the amount AND the user name, alexa will ask you again for the user name later in the dialog.
I hope this will be fixed in the future by Amazon.


Have fun and enjoy the skill!
